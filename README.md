## Setup Instructions
Our team utilized the Raspberry Pi Zero W for this project.
### Enabling UART on the Raspberry Pi
The Raspberry Pi's UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter) is disabled by default. To enable it, the hardware will need to be reconfigured.
The user would need to open terminal and then run:
'sudo raspi-config'
